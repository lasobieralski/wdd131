            <h3>Three Ways to Start Feeling Better Now</h3>
            <!--<p>Here you will find useful articles, tips, and resources for healthier living and managing sugar intake.</p>-->
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Make sure you are drinking enough water
                    <p>It is very important especially as diabetics to make sure that you are getting enough water. The 
                        way you calculate how much you should drink is half (or 50%)of your actual body weight. So for 
                        example if you way 200 pounds you need to be drinking 100 ounces of water. Your water should be 
                        clean and clear. You can add fruits and vegetables to flavor your water. Coffee, broths, sodas, 
                        wines, alcohols do not count as part of your intake of water. So if you drink those items you do 
                        need to consider drinking even more water.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make sure you are getting enough sleep
                    <p>The first thing to understand is that you idealy need 6-8 hours of good quality uninterruped sleep. 
                        Healing and sleep are conducive to feeling better. One of the first things that you need to do to 
                        get a good nights rest is to not watch tv before going to sleep. Idealy it would be best to more 
                        the tv out of your bedroom. You'll want to turn off all electronics 30 minutes prior to sleeping. 
                        Put your cell phones on airplane or sleep mode. Turn off all lights. Cover up alarms or put black 
                        tape on smoke detectors. You really want to look for any kind of light entering into the bedroom. 
                        That includes outside lamps and nightlights. You might consider getting blackout blinds or heavy 
                        duty curtains for windows.</p>
                </li>
                        
                <li>
                    Learn to deal with stress
                    <p>There are three different kinds of stress, emotional, physical, and chemical (toxins). One of the 
                        best ways to deal with a lot of stress is to do something that you really love, something fun, 
                        something you enjoy. I like gardening, taking pictures of nature, hiking, walking, watching a movie, 
                        bicycling, running, etc. Just do something you love. It will be like an escape door just to turn 
                        your mind to something else. Another thing to do is to take time to meditate. This can be a guided 
                        meditation. You could go sit in your car. Take time to clear your mind even if it is only for 2-3 
                        minutes. The third way to relieve stress is to just breathe. You will want to do 10 - 20 repetitions 
                        of deep breathing. Then on the last breath hold it for as long as you can. Then let it out slowly for 
                        as long as you can. You can take 5-10 minutes a day and do this exercise and will notice a difference 
                        in all of the oxygen that you are getting to your brain.</p>
                    <p> We live in a fast paced world. Sometimes we try to run faster than we should. I should know because I 
                        am guilty of that. I have learned that we can feel better and look better when you drink enough water. 
                        You might have frequent bathroom trips, but I promise you that even this will level out and you will 
                        feel better. I know the importance of getting enough rest. Everyone will be different. For me, I can 
                        run really good on seven hours of rest. That is uninterruped rest. After I regulated with water, I would 
                        use the bathroom before bed and now sleep through the night only waking in the morning and going to the 
                        bathroom. Then do something fun. Remember to be conscious about breathing and take in some deep breathes. 
                        This journey to better health is going to be one step at a time. It will come faster than you think.</p>
